# LocoNetKS

This is a simple library with additional functions I missed in the original LocoNET-library for usage with Arduino-platform.<br>

Necessary base-library can be found on https://github.com/mrrwa/LocoNet

Tested on ATmega328.

### Usage
- see examples delivered with original library.
- for added functions please read the comment in [LocoNetKS.h](LocoNetKS.h)
