# LocoNetKS

This is a simple library with additional functions I missed in the original LocoNET-library for usage with Arduino-platform.<br>

In addition, I copied the original LocoNetFastClockClass and modified it.<br>
This was necessary because the original class doesnot work for me during the development of the [Nebenuhr](http://www.github.com/Kruemelbahn/Nebenuhr), a FastClock-Slave which should work with [JMRI](https://www.jmri.org/)<br>

Necessary base-library can be found on https://github.com/mrrwa/LocoNet

Tested on ATmega328.

### Usage
- see examples delivered with original library.
- for added functions please read the comment in [LocoNetKS.h](LocoNetKS.h)
